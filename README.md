# Vigibot-M5StickC-RoverC

After following instructions from Vigibot-Single-ESP32
https://github.com/efeuentertainment/Vigibot-Single-ESP32 ,
this repo is specifically tailored for M5Stack MtStickC
https://github.com/m5stack/M5StickC
on a RoverC robot
https://github.com/m5stack/M5StickC/tree/master/examples/Hat/RoverC .

(This project is not standalone, it requires a raspberry pi with camera running vigibot
https://github.com/vigibot/vigiclient )

Please note that the M5Stack RoverC Plus crashes the ESP32 if the motors draw a lot of power (for example when changing direction)
Issue is noted here https://github.com/m5stack/M5StickC/issues/140
